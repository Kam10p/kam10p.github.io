# The Network Constellation of Personality and Substance Use
Our recently published study entitled “The Network Constellation of Personality and Substance Use: Evolution from Early to Late Adolescence” (Afzali et al., 2020) examined  items  of  the Substance  Use  Risk  Profile  Scale  and  their  longitudinal  relation  to cannabis and alcohol use in adolescence. There is a well‐established link between substance use and four personality traits of anxiety–sensitivity, hopelessness, impulsivity, and sensation‐seeking. However, construct‐level models of personality may conceal indicator‐level personality–outcome associations. This study highlighted the evolution of the network constellation of personality and cannabis/alcohol use from early to late adolescence using graph theory techniques. Our study is praised in the European Journal of Personality editorial indicating "not   only it  provides   a   more   complex   evaluation   of   the relations between personality and outcomes but also provide more  targeted  item  generation  for  future  measures  (e.g.,including more specific items measuring sensation-seeking personality  indicators  in  substance  use)".
